### README for **Server.java** and **Client.java**

This project demonstrates a basic **client-server communication** system using Java sockets. 
The `Server.java` listens for incoming client connections and processes their requests, 
while `Client.java` initiates the connection and sends messages to the server.
It highlights core concepts like networking, socket programming, and message exchange in Java.
